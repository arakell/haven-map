OLD TODO (from core.rb)
(in roughly this order)
- configuration file
- configuration dialog
- saving window state
- custom markers
- multiple map dirs

NEW TODO:
- initial view offset (?)
- initial tile offset (defaults to view offset)

- per-tile drawing (extra zoom)

- source management
- tile normalization button

- "teleport overlay" in merge mode
 

- split map into:
  - MapUI (or Map::UI)
  - MapCommons (or Map::Commons)
  - different handlers for various modes
    - for example tile select mode should have a block to decide what will
      happen after the tile is selected

optimizations:
- message when loading dirs on merge (threaded)
- message when generating maps
