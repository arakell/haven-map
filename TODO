OLD TODO (from core.rb)
(in roughly this order)
- configuration file
- configuration dialog
- saving window state
- custom markers
- multiple map dirs

NEW TODO:
- map generation buffers, then only paint them onto the map
- store tiles (with paths and date) in a db and read only those from disk
- initial view offset
- initial tile offset (defaults to view offset)
- cave layer(s)

- per-tile drawing (extra zoom)
